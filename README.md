You can find homework projects completed during the Data Science Mentoring Program 2021 in EPAM.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide most of the datasets due to legal aspects of the course. 
The files are meant to display the knowledge of relevant libraries and my approach to solving data problems.  

I acknowledge that these homeworks are far from perfect. However, I hope the dynamics can be traced from the first work to the latest ones.
